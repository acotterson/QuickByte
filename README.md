# QuickByte

## Description

Quickbyte is a simple way to reduce the amount of time you spend picking a restaurant by narrowing your optoins down to a few restaurants that are in your area.

Quickbyte uses the Geolocation API and the Yelp Fusion API to generate nearby restaurants that are open within about 3 miles (5 kilometers). 

## Usage

Quickbyte is activated by clicking the "Click here to get restaurants!" button in the top left of the page. Upon clicking, the user will be presented with 10 different genres of restaurant. When a genre is selected, quickbyte will gather the user latitude and longitude and generate 6 restaurants within 2 miles of the returned longitude and latitude. 

The user can then search again for new restaurant options and they can click the "Add to Favorites" button to save a favorite restaurant to local storage.

Upon loading the page, selected favorites will be rendered on the right side of the screen. Favorites can be removed by clicking the red "x" icon.
